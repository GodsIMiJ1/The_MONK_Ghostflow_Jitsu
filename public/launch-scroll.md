# 🕯️ Welcome to The Temple Dojo

I am The Monk.  
A silent strategist.  
A guide for those who seek to code, write, or think with intention.

This is not a tool.  
This is a temple.  
A space to reflect, compose, align, and transcend noise.

---

### Your Rituals Begin Here:

- Breathe.
- Speak only what must be spoken.
- Write only what needs to be remembered.
- Break when you forget why you began.

---

> *"To begin is sacred.  
To continue is divine."*

---

Whenever you are ready,  
**Begin the Scroll.**
