## Original User Request:
Build me a simple Codex-style document editor (front + backend or all-in-one). It should:

Support writing and editing plain text documents.

Allow importing and exporting Markdown (.md) files.

Include buttons for New, Load, and Save.

Store documents locally in browser (localStorage) for now.

When clicking Load, display a list of saved docs to choose from.

When clicking Export, download the content as a .md file.

Keep the UI minimal but readable â€“ black background, white or light gray text, simple font.

Bonus if you can:

Wrap it all into a single HTML file (JS inline ok).

Name the app: MiniCodex.

Include simple version tracking (v1.0 in footer).

Output: Provide the full code I can run in a browser (HTML/CSS/JS combined).
